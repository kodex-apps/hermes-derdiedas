## DESCRIPTION

DerDieDasSpiel is a web app you can find under https://derdiedasspiel.de that allows you to practice the German articles Der, Die and Das (a common difficulty among learners). The words used here are listed in the DWDS (Digitales WÃ¶rterbuch der Deutschen Sprache).

You can play alone or against any number of players to see who gets the best score.
